# Hi, I'm Van Le ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a **Freelance Software Tester** at Test IO, studying to become a Software and Android Developer. I also serve in the Virginia Army National Guard. I love game dev, dogs, and learning new things. My superpower is adapting to anythingâ€”I've been a sales manager, marketing manager, and business owner, so Iâ€™m basically a real-life multitasking machine.
